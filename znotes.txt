Installing express
------------------
npm install --save express
where --save stores an entry in package.json file

Installing node monitor (nodemon)
---------------------------------
npm install --save-dev nodemon
where --save-dev saves the nodemon in package.json file and only uses this package in development
mode. Since this package is not installed globally, we need to go to our package.json file and do
some changes we open package.json and go to script and add
"start:server":"nodemon server.js"
the LHS value "start:server" can be any name based on our wish. so to execute the nodemon we need to
provide the command
npm run start:server
